Modules to work on:
- [x] Graph for Wave (line/point) 0.025 seconds (1/40 second)
- [x] Graph for Frequency analysis (20-20k Hz logarithmic scale)
- [x] Graph master class that renders above two graphs
- [x] FFT implementation — Emily? What do we need? What will we get?
- [ ] (Music) Keyboard implementation — probably easier, using same handleFrequency calls as keypad
- [ ] .wav file, extract stream in, read
- [x] Update Main to make decisions to graph on input, output
- [x] Move AudioContext to main, need it for mic read
- [x] Update FormMain, webpack to add other forms (quick)
- [x] Update FormMain to return stream direction to Main
- [x] Microphone class to take in stream — might be easier to get graphs working first
- [x] Fix gain scale in freq form, move from white noise form to forms
- [ ] Labels for graphs?
- [ ] More responsiveness? Threading?
- [ ] Git rid of garbage text
- [ ] enable space to pause  ?: pause graph, or graph and all sounds?
- [ ] Mouse drag for create sounds ?: just in freq mode? Does it matter?
- [ ] Canvas animation (?)
- [ ] Redo white noise as buffer (?)
- [ ] error checking / modal?
- [ ] Instructions to the user / NotesToUser or Main update
- [ ] Form sending changeFormState (or something) to Main
- [ ] Bars for logarithmic scale on freq graph
- [ ] TESTING
- [ ] Other usage suggestions?
