Modules to work on:
- [x] Graph for Wave (line/point) 0.025 seconds (1/40 second)
- [x] Graph for Frequency analysis (20-20k Hz logarithmic scale)
- [x] Graph master class that renders above two graphs
- [x] FFT implementation — Emily? What do we need? What will we get?
- [x] (Music) Keyboard implementation — probably easier, using same handleFrequency calls as keypad
- [x] Update Main to make decisions to graph on input, output
- [x] Move AudioContext to main, need it for mic read
- [x] Update FormMain, webpack to add other forms (quick)
- [x] Update FormMain to return stream direction to Main
- [x] Microphone class to take in stream — might be easier to get graphs working first
- [x] Fix gain scale in freq form, move from white noise form to forms
- [x] More responsiveness? Threading?
- [x] Git rid of garbage text
- [x] enable space to pause  ?: pause graph, or graph and all sounds?
- [x] Instructions to the user / NotesToUser or Main update
- [x] Form sending changeFormState (or something) to Main
- [x] Bars for logarithmic scale on freq graph
- [x] BUG -- 440/10, 350/10 playing, change 350/10 to 350/0 and update -- all audio stops
- [x] BUG -- press and drag off button (in keyboard/dial pad mode) keeps playing
      onmouseout HTML would work but will send extra stop sound calls
      ondragleave HTML might be better?
- [x] maybe add scrolling <div> at the bottom for keyboard window
- [x] implement Shepherd's Paradox
- [x] change frequency object to frequency, gain arrays
- [x] Try to find away to keep microphone from playing/feeding back
- [x] Mouse drag for create sounds
- [x] allow for multi-tonal keyboard output
- [x] Maybe add a volume / gain slider to keypad and piano forms
- [ ] .wav file, extract stream in, read
- [x] Labels for graphs?
- [ ] TESTING
- [ ] In button class, add second keypress option to allow multiple keypresses
      for piano form to allow middle C to be q and , at the same time
- [ ] Maybe rescale gain for 0 - 100 or 20 since sliders don't care
- [ ] Shephard option: allow up, down arrows to change base tone
- [x] mouse drag tones take over audio context - maybe a form reset option?
- [x] Remove testing, unused components from project before turnin
- [ ] Check to make sure state set with componentWillMount instead of did
- [ ] Volume control on the Shep form
- [ ] Undo pause Audio with spacebar
- [x] Auto Shephard tone up, down with button
- [ ] Play / Pause Audio with button
- [x] Unfocus (blur()) on menu change
- [x] "" "" "" on EVERY button press
- [ ] Time vs. Displacement
- [ ] Frequency (Hz) vs. Energy
- [x] change "about" to "instructions"
- [ ] Callout box on paused
- [ ] Unpause on mode change
