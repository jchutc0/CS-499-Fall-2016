Modules to work on:
- [x] Graph for Wave (line/point) 0.025 seconds (1/40 second)
- [x] Graph for Frequency analysis (20-20k Hz logarithmic scale)
- [x] Graph master class that renders above two graphs
- [x] FFT implementation — Emily? What do we need? What will we get?
- [x] (Music) Keyboard implementation — probably easier, using same handleFrequency calls as keypad
- [ ] .wav file, extract stream in, read
- [x] Update Main to make decisions to graph on input, output
- [x] Move AudioContext to main, need it for mic read
- [x] Update FormMain, webpack to add other forms (quick)
- [x] Update FormMain to return stream direction to Main
- [x] Microphone class to take in stream — might be easier to get graphs working first
- [x] Fix gain scale in freq form, move from white noise form to forms
- [ ] Labels for graphs?
- [x] More responsiveness? Threading?
- [x] Git rid of garbage text
- [x] enable space to pause  ?: pause graph, or graph and all sounds?
- [ ] Mouse drag for create sounds
- [ ] error checking / modal?     -- Adam
- [x] Instructions to the user / NotesToUser or Main update
- [x] Form sending changeFormState (or something) to Main
- [x] Bars for logarithmic scale on freq graph
- [ ] TESTING
- [x] BUG -- 440/10, 350/10 playing, change 350/10 to 350/0 and update -- all audio stops
- [x] BUG -- press and drag off button (in keyboard/dial pad mode) keeps playing
      onmouseout HTML would work but will send extra stop sound calls
      ondragleave HTML might be better?
- [x] maybe add scrolling <div> at the bottom for keyboard window
- [x] implement Shepherd's Paradox
- [x] change frequency object to frequency, gain arrays
- [ ] allow for multi-tonal keyboard output
