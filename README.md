## Web-based Audio Frequency Analyzer
In this project, we hope to create a web-based audio frequency analyzer for our client.

*Usage:* To use the Audio Frequency Analyzer as is, download the contents of the `react/public` directory and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.  The code is compiled from JSX ES6 code to more browser-friendly Javascript ES5 code in the `bundle.js` file.

*Recompile instructions:* Instructions to recompile the code are included in the `recompile.md` file and include instructions on software you will need to do the recompile.
